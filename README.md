# Socket File Transfer

This program allows you to transfer files between devices on your local network. I created this app because I used to email myself any resources and then download them onto a new machine or used a USB drive which was a bit of a pain.

### Disclaimer
This project was for educational purposes. No security measures have been put in place to block out potentially unwanted processes from viewing the data of the files.

### How to run

* Start by cloning into the repo and then `cd` into the repository's location.
* Edit the variables on line 21 and 22 in `main.go` to match your environment.
* Run `go get`.
* Run `go run main.go`
